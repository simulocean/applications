# CRC-Base Image
This is a containerized distribution of the base image packaged by Louisiana State University Coastal Resilience Collaboratory (https://crc.cct.lsu.edu/). The CRC-base image is built upon the CentOS 7 base image. Compilers and other tools and libraries are then installed to build Docker images for various models.
