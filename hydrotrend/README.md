HydroTrend is an ANSI-standard C numerical model that creates synthetic river discharge and sediment load time series as a function of climate trends and basin morphology and has been used to study the sediment flux to a basin for basin filling models. As a drainage basin simulator, the model provides time series of daily discharge hydraulics at a river mouth, including the sediment load properties. HydroTrend was designed to provide input to lake or shelf circulation and sedimentation models (Steckler et al., 1996; Syvitski and Alcott, 1995b), and study the impact of land-sea fluxes given climatic change scenarios (Moore, 1992; Syvitski and Andrews, 1994). HydroTrend simulates the major processes that occur in a river basin, including:
* Glacierized areas with advances and retreats depending on the climate scenario,
* Snow accumulation in the winter and melt in the subsequent spring/summer,
* Rainfall over the remaining portions of the basin with canopy evaporation,
* Groundwater recharging and discharging,
* The impact of reservoirs.
